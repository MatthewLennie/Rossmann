look at GPU usage ->   watch -d -n 0.5 nvidia-smi 
Things to check 
-Hyperparameters to include 
    - Batch size - done
    - Embedding sizes - done
    - depth - done
    - layer sizes - done
    - Momentum - 
    - Dropout - Done
- turn EXP_rsme into METRIC NOT loss
- how does fastAI do the embedding layers. 
- LR Finder
- Is batch norm implemented as it is intended to be 
- validation set in eval mode to avoid drop out. 
- is faster with memory async
- renormalization
