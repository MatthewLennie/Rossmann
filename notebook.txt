look at GPU usage ->   watch -d -n 0.5 nvidia-smi 
when running python from command line: 
source /home/paperspace/anaconda3/bin/activate
conda activate fastai2. 

Good Hyperparameters seem to be. 
Cosine:30, lr: 0.001, batchsize: 100000, layers:[248, 40, 10, 2], dropout:0.1, momentum: [0.9, 0.999]
GPU error possible stemmed from my conditional breakpoint!

Things to check 
-Hyperparameters to include 
    - Batch size - done
    - Embedding sizes - done
    - depth - done
    - layer sizes - done
    - Momentum -  NEED TO DO.
    - Dropout - 0.8 results in really unstable training. Just too much. 
- LR Finder
- Is batch norm implemented as it is intended to be 
- is faster with memory async
- renormalization
